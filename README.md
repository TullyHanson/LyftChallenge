#Lyft Challenge

The goal is to calculate the detour distance between two different rides. Given four latitude/longitude pairs, where driver one is traveling from point A to point B and driver two is traveling from point C to point D, we would like to calculate the shorter of the detour distances the drivers would need to take to pick-up and drop-off the other driver.

In other words, we want to determine which path is shorter: A->C->D->B or C->A->B->D.
